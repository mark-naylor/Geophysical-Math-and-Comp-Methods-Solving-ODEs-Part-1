title: Numerical solutions to ODEs - Part 1
description: In this course, you will explore the basics of solving ODEs. You will use the `scipy` ODE solvers to solve 1st order ODEs. You will apply these methods to solve coupled ODEs and higher order ODEs where the boundary conditions are specified at a single point in space or time, i.e. initial vaule problems. Finally, we will peek under the lid and see how these solvers actually work.
